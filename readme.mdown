Radiation Dose Chart
====================

A few days ago @desandro tweeted: "Call to the community: Re-make [http://xkcd.com/radiation/](http://xkcd.com/radiation/) in HTML / CSS. Use CSS scale transforms to zoom in / out"


For now I just got the scaling nailed down and an example for each level to indicate the scale.

Issues
------
* The 'deepest' level isn't to-scale. It's too small at scale and the scaling breaks.  
* Eventually want to get all the info from the XKCD version in using either a click or hover to expand each level.

Thanks
